# Tyler Southworth

**`Data Scientist`**

I'm a bioinformatics graduate student set to graduate in May 2023. During my graduate school education, I have developed strong programming abilities in both Python and Java, and gained a thorough understanding of database engineering and management including both SQL and NoSQL systems. I have also put my machine learning knowledge into practice by using techniques such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks to solve problems that I find intriguing.

As I approach graduation, I am actively seeking job opportunities in the data science field, specifically within the domains of finance, genomics, and energy. I am confident that I can bring substantial value to a company while also continuously developing my own skills and sharing my knowledge with others. My expertise will allow me to tackle complex data science problems and drive impactful solutions for my employer.
